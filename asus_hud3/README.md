# bgrt-hud_3

A refined and universal derivative of the **hud_3** Plymouth theme, featuring a robust and reliable password entry mechanism.

This theme is optimized for **minimalist Linux environments**, such as **Void Linux (musl libc)**, or any setup where **font rendering in early userspace is unreliable or unavailable**.

Based on the original **hud_3** theme by **adi1090x**.

📘 **Русская версия:** [README-ru.md](README-ru.md)

## Motivation

The password input field and indicators are implemented as **pre-rendered PNG assets**, ensuring consistent behavior across all systems.
